Developed on the MERN Stack and enhanced by TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, AcademicSync is an intelligent web-based timetable management system that automates conflict-free timetable generation suitable for real academic environments, thus alleviating the restrictions placed on manual scheduling systems. There are four main distinguishing components of the system, allocation of time slots based on staff seniority, support for continuous three-hour blocks for lectures and tutorials, with optimized transition times between campus buildings, and an editable interface whereby senior administrators can shift schedules in real time according to hall capacity, staff availability, and student needs. Fusing algorithms with adaptability, AcademicSync offers a user-friendly yet flexible solution to academicÂ institutions.
